# MissingGOJava
A Java program I started writing in early 2019 for tracking what Pokemon I was missing from PokemonGo.

Some of this code is insane, but there are some things (mainly the data) that I'll use going forward.

I'm planning on rewriting this in JS, ditching excel for PG, and giving it a nice frontend
